# TaskBoard (for iOS)

## What is working in the app
* Can create a task
* Can list all tasks (only the title)
* Can compare "state" by "done or not" in tasks list (green or red)
* Can show detail of a task
* Can mark a task as done or not
* Can delete a done task
* Persistant storage using [realm.io](https://realm.io/) (Optional)

PS: I'm realy sorry for the UI...
